Class 5: A Class-Recommender for Princeton Students
https://class-5.herokuapp.com

They say college is the best 4 years of your life, so how can you make the most of it? By taking the best courses! But how can you find the best courses without having to painfully sift through the registrar, ask an endless number of friends for their opinions, and still pick a class you don't enjoy? The solution is Class 5.

Class 5 is the solution that helps Princeton students find the best courses for them with the click of a button. First, a user inputs a selection of some courses they like and some courses they dislike for Class 5 to build a user profile. Class 5 then utilizes preferences from other users to suggest the best courses. Based on the userâ€™s own preferences, combined with preferences of other students with similar interests or academic paths, each user receives suggested courses that will guide their course selection decisions. We hope not only to ease the class-hunting process, but to expose students to quality courses that they might not have taken otherwise.

Feel free to look around in the code, but note that there are multiple hidden constants due to security (i.e. our database password). This also means that this codebase is not runnable as is.
